personal beginner's guide to github repository and code management -  to be deleted after use

This README is dedicated to the creator's personal life situation.
1. It is not dire - but easily understandable as you read further into the bio section (TBC).
2. There is a sense of cultural conflicts involved - not many coders discusss their real life to be associated with their programming, but oftentimes your consious commitment to coding has some impace on why and how you code. 
3. My time on this world is short - average lifespan is not enough for me to pursue eery passion of mine, so it is best to be able to balance out my passions that I have laid out below. Analyse what you will - these are my personal goals.
